### HEADLINE
# The 6-Month Loophole is Yours. Exploited Daily.

### SUB-HEADLINE
VeriFuse delivers verified, statute-compliant foreclosure surplus data **180 days before** "Finders" are legally allowed to touch it. You're an attorney. The ban doesn't apply to you.

### THE PROBLEM

Every foreclosure sale in Colorado generates surplus. Right now, that money sits in county accounts — unclaimed, uncontested, and decaying toward escheatment.

Professional "finders" are locked out for 180 days under C.R.S. 38-38-111. But you're not a finder. You're counsel. **The statute exempts attorneys acting on behalf of former owners.**

The question isn't whether the money exists. It's whether you'll file before someone else does.

### THE 3 PILLARS

**PILLAR 1 — Day 1 Access**
You are exempt from the 6-month finder restriction. VeriFuse identifies surplus the day it hits the county ledger — deed recorded, sale confirmed, surplus calculated. No waiting period. No compliance risk. You file when you're ready.

**PILLAR 2 — Sovereign Verification**
Every asset in your packet has been cross-referenced against the county recorder, the case docket, and the sale ledger. Deed ownership. Debt position. Surplus math. We don't send you "leads." We send you a **Pre-Litigation Evidence Packet** — case-ready on arrival.

**PILLAR 3 — The 10% vs 20% Advantage**
Colorado statute caps attorney contingency fees at different rates depending on when and how you file. VeriFuse maps every asset to its governing statute — C.R.S. 38-38-111 (foreclosure, 5-year window) or C.R.S. 39-11-151 (tax sale, 3-year window) — so you know your fee ceiling before you pick up the phone.

### WHAT YOU RECEIVE

Each verified asset arrives as a **Case Packet** containing:
- County, case number, and recorder reference link
- Owner of record with last known address
- Verified surplus amount and sale date
- Applicable statute, window, and days remaining
- Data provenance and confidence grade

No raw data. No spreadsheets. No guesswork.
